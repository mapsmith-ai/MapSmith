"""The one place MapSmith opens a vector dataset.

Why it has to be one place. GeoParquet 2.0 moved geometry into Parquet's own
``GEOMETRY``/``GEOGRAPHY`` logical types and demoted the ``geo`` metadata key to
optional, so "open a vector file" grew a second branch. In 0.2.2 that branch was
added to two of the six read paths and not to the other four (#28): the same
file that ``describe_layer`` opened, ``preview_map`` refused, in the same
session. A capability that lives in one function cannot be half-applied; one
that is copied into six call sites cannot stay applied.

The other half of #28 was mixing up two different questions. *Resolving* a CRS
declaration answers "what coordinate system is this", and its failure must be
honest — ``None`` plus a reason. *Labelling* a CRS answers "what do we write in
the manifest", and it may compress. Feeding a label back in as if it were a CRS
made a file that states its CRS read as CRS-less, whenever the CRS had no EPSG
code and pyproj happened to name it ``unknown``. So resolution lives here and
returns pyproj objects; presentation lives in :func:`mapsmith.verify.crs_label`
and returns strings, and neither calls the other.

    ``srid:<n>`` is deliberately NOT resolved. The spec defines it as a numeric
