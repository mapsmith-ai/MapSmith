"""Refuse agent-written SQL that carries a credential, instead of redacting it.

Issue #18 started from a manifest leak: ``run_sql`` records the query verbatim,
manifests are meant to be shared, so ``CREATE SECRET (... SECRET 'AKIA…')``
ended up in an artifact this project encourages people to attach to a bug
report. The first fix was redaction — mask the value, keep the statement
readable — and an adversarial audit took it apart in minutes. Measured against
the shipped 0.2.1 matcher, all four of these left the secret in the manifest:

    CREATE SECRET t (TYPE http, EXTRA_HTTP_HEADERS MAP{'Authorization': 'Bearer X'})
    CREATE SECRET s (TYPE S3, SECRET E'shh\\'x')      -- escaped-string literal
    CREATE SECRET s (TYPE S3, SECRET $$shh$$)         -- dollar quoting
    CREATE SECRET s (TYPE S3, SECRET /* c */ 'shh')   -- comment between the two

The second one is worse than a miss: the ``E'`` prefix desynchronises the quote
pairing, so the matcher redacted a *different* argument and kept the secret —
a manifest that is both wrong and leaky. That is the shape of the problem:
redaction is a text scan without a SQL parser, and every dialect has one more
way to write a string. Chasing them one at a time is a losing race, so the
statement itself is refused before it runs and there is nothing left to redact.

What that costs: nothing documented. No README, doc page or notebook shows
credentials being configured through ``run_sql``, and in MapSmith's sandbox
exactly one secret type is even constructible (``http`` — extension autoloading
is off, so ``TYPE s3``/``azure``/``postgres`` fail with "does not exist"). What
it protects is the case that matters: a credential the *user* pasted into the
chat, which the model then writes into SQL, which MapSmith writes into a file
meant to be published.

Redaction stays in ``provenance.redact_secrets`` as a second layer, because a
credential can reach a manifest through a parameter that is not SQL at all.
