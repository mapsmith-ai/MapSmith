"""Four operations for the moment somebody is about to publish a map of noise.

They come from the discovery benchmark, in the words of the people who had the
problem: *"the high-count villages seem grouped but I'm not sure what I'm
seeing"*, *"the district-level tuberculosis rates are jumping wildly from 0 to
800 per 100,000 just because [the denominators are tiny]"*, *"the ethics
committee is breathing down my neck about patient confidentiality"*, *"over a
million dots, so the map completely freezes"*. Both independent labellers marked
all four `none`.

What they have in common is that the naive answer is not an error, it is a
picture. A choropleth of raw rates over small populations maps population size;
a hot-spot map without a multiple-testing correction finds clusters in random
data; publishing a count of two identifies a person. None of that raises
anything, which is why these belong in a product about verifiable results rather
than in a notebook.

No new dependency. `math.erfc` gives the normal tail exactly, the weights matrices
here are small by construction, and a package whose tie-breaking we did not
control would make two runs of the same data disagree.

    that the eye finds clusters in random data, and so does this statistic if
    you let it. **Every feature is a hypothesis test**, so over 300 districts at
    the conventional 0.05 about fifteen come back significant from noise alone,

    `gi_z` (the standard deviate), `gi_p` (its two-sided p-value) and
    `significant` — which is a Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery-rate decision
    at `alpha` across all features, not a per-feature threshold. `hot_or_cold`
    says which tail a significant feature is in. The uncorrected count is in the
    result and in the manifest so the difference is visible rather than implied.

    Gi* INCLUDES the feature itself, which is the starred variant and the one
