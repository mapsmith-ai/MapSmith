"""Questions whose answer is a number, not a layer.

Of sixty-one catalog operations, three produced an `answer` and none of them
took a vector layer. That is not a gap in coverage, it is a gap in *shape*: a
caller holding parcels and asking how much land there is had nothing to be
offered, because every operation that computes it writes the number into a
column and hands back a dataset. The discovery layer found this the hard way —
a search declaring `input_kind="vector", produces="answer"` left zero candidates
and came back as a choice between nothing.

So these four read and write nothing. No output path, no manifest, no
provenance record: there is no artefact to carry one, and inventing a file to
have something to attach a manifest to would be worse than the gap. What travels
instead is inside the answer — every statistic says what it was computed OVER,
because a mean over a column with nulls in it and a mean over the rows that had
values are different numbers with the same name.

Two of them are statistics with a literature and a trap each:

* **Moran's I** is the global companion of the local Gi* in `spatial_stats`.
  Same neighbourhoods, same reason to care about how they were built — a
  contiguity that finds no neighbours turns the statistic into noise.
* **The nearest-neighbour index** is not a property of the points. R is a ratio
  against what random points in *an area* would do, and the area is a choice the
  caller makes. Take the points' own bounding box and a clustered pattern
  reports itself as more clustered than it is, because the box shrank around it.
  This one refuses to hide that: the area is either given or it is the convex
  hull, and the answer says which and how big.
