    A GeoPackage layer may declare its type as GEOMETRY and hold whatever it
    likes; GeoJSON never restricted it either. Only the shapefile enforced one
    type per file, which is why this arrives exactly when data is converted out
    of shapefiles and the split the old format imposed is merged away.

    The consequence is not an error and cannot be one. Shapely answers `length`
    on a polygon with its perimeter, which is a real quantity and the right
    answer to a question nobody asked; it answers `area` on a line with zero,
    which is also true. So a total over a mixed layer is a total of two
    different things, every individual row is still correct, and a spot check of
    the data confirms the data.

    Measured by Argleton trap 027 on 2026-08-30: five pipe runs and one
    treatment plant in one layer, and the total length came back 3000 m where
    the pipe is 2000 — the plant's fence line, added in silence.

    Not critical. Measuring a mixed layer is a legitimate thing to ask for and
    MapSmith cannot know which features the question was about. What it can do
    is refuse to let the answer arrive without the sentence.

    First, the JOIN. Shapely returns the cells as a collection whose order is an
    implementation detail, not the input order: zip them with the points and
    every attribute lands on a neighbour's cell. The result is a map that is
    correct in shape, wrong in every value, and indistinguishable from the right
    one. This asks shapely for the ordered form AND then verifies the join
    geometrically -- each output cell must contain the point whose row it
    carries. A declaration that the order is right is not a check; containment
    is.

    Second, the BOUNDARY. The cells of the outermost points are infinite, so
    every real Voronoi layer is a clipped one, and the clip decides their areas.
    An area computed over these polygons is therefore partly a property of the
    boundary, not of the data: `boundary` says which one was used (the points'

    *convert or select the line geometry first*. Both were pointing at an

    that is a filter.

    Four ways to ask, and deliberately no fifth:

    * ``by="geometry_type"`` with ``value="line"`` (or ``point``/``polygon``, or
      an exact type like ``"MultiPolygon"``). A family keeps its Multi variant
      too, because a MultiLineString is line-shaped and somebody asking for the

    * ``by="field_in"`` with ``field`` and ``values``.
    * ``by="field_between"`` with ``field`` and ``minimum``/``maximum``,

    """Take one layer out of a multi-layer container, into a dataset of its own.

    MapSmith refuses a container with more than one layer, because the format's
    default is the first layer and a manifest could not honestly say which data
    produced the numbers (issue #29, and Argleton trap 006 measured the old
    behaviour). The refusal has always told the caller what to do instead —
    *extract the layer you mean into its own dataset* — and then handed them a
    `run_sql` incantation, because there was no operation for it.

    This is that operation. It is the natural next step after
    `describe_dataset`, which lists a container's layers precisely so that one
    can be chosen.

    An unknown layer name is refused with the list of real ones rather than an
    empty result, because a typo and an empty layer are different problems and
    only one of them is the caller's data.

    A layer with no CRS is refused too, by the shared precondition, and that is
    worth knowing before it happens: it makes this a dead end for the one case
    somebody most wants it for — pulling a broken layer out of a container in
    order to fix it. The refusal is deliberate (invariant 4, and
    `convert_format` refuses the same input), but the way out today is `run_sql`
    rather than this operation. Recorded as a decision to take, not a gap to
    discover.
