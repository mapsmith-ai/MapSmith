"""The Esri backend: ONE operation routed, run in ArcGIS Pro's own Python.

One and not seventy-two, deliberately. What this proves is that the path exists
end to end — stack chosen, licence discovered, tool run, fallback recorded — on
an operation whose equivalence with the open source stack is **measured** rather
than assumed (D-056 point 5). Adding a second is then a table entry, a probe,
and a call to `stacks.route` in the operation.

That last part is the correction. This module used to declare three, and
`available_for` reported all three usable, while `stacks.route` was called from
exactly one place. With the Esri stack requested, `centroid_layer` and
`dissolve_layer` ran on the open source stack and **no manifest note recorded
the substitution** — the one thing this design says never happens quietly, on
the operation where the vendor drops every attribute. A table entry is a promise
that requesting the stack reaches it, so the table now holds only what does, and
`test_every_declared_esri_tool_is_actually_routed` keeps it honest in both
directions.

The measurement of 2026-08-30 covered three, and what it found is more
interesting than a match.
Compared across the two stacks on the same fixture, through the same reader,
into the same container:

    buffer      geometry identical  · ArcGIS adds BUFF_DIST, ORIG_FID
    centroids   geometry identical  · ArcGIS adds ORIG_FID
    dissolve    geometry identical  · ArcGIS adds Id and DROPS every attribute

**The geometry deltas match on all three. The schemas do not match on any of
them**, and the dissolve difference is not cosmetic: a pipeline that dissolves
and then reads a column gets the column on one stack and nothing on the other.
That is silent data loss on substitution, which is the precise failure a
provenance product exists to prevent.

So the measurement does not license a silent swap — it licenses a **recorded**
one, and it is the reason `record.notes` carries the schema delta rather than a
reassuring sentence. The first version of the comparison omitted the column
fields and reported all three as matching; the difference was there all along
and the check was not looking at it.

Two caveats remain, written here rather than discovered later: three pairs are
the easy case, chosen because a method that cannot recognise these recognises
nothing; and a fixture of two squares cannot find geodesic-against-planar
buffers or invalid-geometry handling. Those are Argleton's job.

## The boundary

ArcPy lives in ArcGIS Pro's conda environment, so MapSmith cannot import it:
every call is a subprocess that reads and writes files. That is the same shape
invariant 7 imposes on QGIS for a licensing reason, arrived at here for a
technical one.
