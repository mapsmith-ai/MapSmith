"""Engine dispatcher: route each workload class to the fastest available engine.

The 2025-2026 published engine benchmarks are unambiguous (upstream figures,
not ours — MapSmith's own measurements live in docs/benchmarks.md):
- SedonaDB wins heavy joins/KNN by 10-180x, in-process, optional dependency.
- DuckDB spatial wins filters/aggregations/point-in-polygon (~2M rows/sec).
- GeoPandas/Shapely stays as the long-tail lane (<~1M features).

Engines are optional imports: the dispatcher degrades gracefully and the
provenance manifest always records which engine actually ran.
