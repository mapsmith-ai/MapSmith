"""Routing over a line network, with the ways it silently lies made visible.

Two operations — the cheapest route between two places, and everything reachable
within a budget — over a network the caller supplies as a line layer. Both come
from the discovery benchmark, where six of the twenty-one requests neither
labeller could place were network questions: *"which residential blocks are
further than a 10-minute walk from any primary care clinic using the actual street
network"*, *"the cheapest path to lay underground line from Substation 4 that
avoids steep slopes"*, *"which emergency rooms become completely cut off if the
riverfront arterial roads submerge"*.

**The failure mode this module is built around is not a wrong number, it is a
disconnected graph.** Two street segments whose endpoints are a millimetre apart
are one junction on the ground and two nodes in a naive build, so the route goes
the long way round or is reported as impossible — and nothing raises, because a
graph with a gap in it is a perfectly valid graph. That is why `tolerance` has no
default, why the number of merged endpoints and the number of connected
components are in every manifest, and why snapping an origin four kilometres to
the nearest node is reported rather than absorbed.

No new dependency: the graph and Dijkstra are forty lines here, they are exactly
deterministic, and the alternative was to pull in a package whose tie-breaking
between equal-cost paths we would not control.

    `network_shortest_path` answers this where roads exist. This answers it where
    they do not: a cable trench avoiding steep ground, a haul road, a pipeline
    corridor, a wildlife crossing. The cost raster says what one cell of travel
    is worth — a slope reclassified into a penalty, a habitat score, a price per
    metre — and the route returned is the one whose total is smallest.

    **Cost is per unit of distance, not per cell**, and the difference decides
    the answer. Crossing a cell diagonally is √2 times as far as crossing it
    square-on, so a diagonal step costs √2 times as much; an implementation that
    charges one cell one unit finds staircase routes that a person would never
    walk and that are genuinely cheaper under its own arithmetic. Each step here
    is charged the mean of the two cells it joins, times the distance travelled.

    Nodata is impassable, not free and not expensive: a cell with no cost is a
    cell nothing is known about, and the route goes around it. Zero and negative
    costs are refused — a zero-cost cell makes every route through it free, and
    a negative one makes the shortest path infinitely cheap by going round in
    circles, which is not an error any output would show.

    The result is one line from start to end with the accumulated cost on it,
    plus the cost, the number of steps and the straight-line distance for
    comparison. A route far longer than the straight line is usually right; a
    route exactly as long as the straight line usually means the cost surface is
    uniform and nothing was avoided.
