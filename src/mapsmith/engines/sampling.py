"""Reading a surface where somebody stands, walks, or looks.

Three operations that all come down to the same question — what does the raster
say at this place — and differ in what "this place" means: a set of points, a
line walked at a fixed step, or the sight line between two positions.

They exist because the discovery benchmark asked for them in the words of people
who had the problem: *"my total station elevations along the centerline are
consistently two tenths higher than the city's surface"*, *"elevation at every 20
metres along the centreline so I can plot the profile"*, *"line of sight check,
this site to that site, is the ridge blocking it"*. Both independent labellers
marked all three `none`: the catalogue could not serve them.

The recurring hazard here is the silent null. A point outside the raster, or on a
nodata cell, samples to nothing — and a table with nulls in it looks exactly like
a table without them until somebody averages it. So every operation in this
module counts what it could not read and puts that count in the manifest as a
check, not a footnote.
