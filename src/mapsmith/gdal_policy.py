"""Take GDAL's indirection and network drivers off the table when remote is off.

The path guard and the SQL scan both work on the string they are handed. GDAL
does not: it resolves indirection files itself, in-process. A ``.vrt`` is a plain
local path — no scheme, no ``/vsi`` prefix, nothing for a textual check to catch
— and GDAL then fetches whatever its ``<SrcDataSource>`` names.

Measured before this module existed, with ``MAPSMITH_ALLOW_REMOTE`` unset *and*
``MAPSMITH_WORKSPACE`` set: reading a ``.vrt`` from inside the workspace through
pyogrio sent HEAD and GET to an attacker-named host. That contradicted the one
promise SECURITY.md states as testable — no network egress in sandbox mode — so
the fix has to be at GDAL's level, not at the string's. DuckDB's spatial reader
was already safe there, because it routes GDAL I/O through DuckDB's own
filesystem with external access off; the GeoPandas/pyogrio path had no such gate,
which is the path most tools take.

``GDAL_SKIP`` / ``OGR_SKIP`` deregister drivers at registration time, so this has
to run **before** anything imports pyogrio, rasterio or duckdb's spatial
extension — hence the call in ``mapsmith/__init__``. Unknown names in those lists
are ignored by GDAL, which is what keeps this safe across GDAL versions.

With ``MAPSMITH_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`` nothing is skipped: an operator who has decided
to allow remote data gets VRT, WMS and the rest, because that is the whole point
of the switch.

# Why this list keeps growing, and why a test guards it instead of a comment.
#
# The list was correct when it was written and became incomplete because GDAL
# shipped a new driver. GDALG (*GDAL Streamed Algorithm*, GDAL 3.11) reads a
# JSON document holding a `gdal` command line and runs it when the dataset is
# opened — a .vrt by another name, with two aggravating differences: it is
# recognised by CONTENT rather than by extension, so any filename works, and the
# command line can name a local path as easily as a URL. Measured on 0.2.2 with
# remote reads off AND a workspace set: a file called `roads.geojson` inside the
# workspace fetched a URL, and another read a dataset from OUTSIDE the workspace
# and handed back its rows. That is containment broken, not only egress.
#
# MRF is narrower (extension-gated) but the same shape: its <CachedSource> is
# fetched on the first pixel read. The rest of the additions are the drivers
# GDAL's own security page names as opening other datasets internally.
#
# MBTiles is on that page too and is deliberately NOT here: it is a
# mainstream tile container someone may legitimately want to read, and
# skipping it costs real functionality for a risk nobody has demonstrated
# against MapSmith. Written down rather than left as an omission — the next
# reader would otherwise wonder whether it was forgotten.
#
# The lesson is about the method, not the names: a deny-list of an evolving set
# is a list that is wrong between one upstream release and the next.
# `test_no_new_driver_escapes_the_policy` fails when GDAL registers something we
# have never reviewed, which is the only version of this check that keeps
# working.
