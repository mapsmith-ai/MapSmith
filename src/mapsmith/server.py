    Ranking alone does not scale, and this is measured rather than assumed: over
    800 GIS operations, searching by words alone finds the right one in the top 3
    about a third of the time. Declaring what you already know takes it to seven
    times in ten, with no model involved — the catalog simply drops what cannot
    apply before ranking anything.

        facets you declare                    candidates left    found@3
        (none)                                            800        20%

        input_kind + produces + category                   16        70%

    So fill these in whenever you know them, and you usually do:

    - **input_kind** — what you are holding: 'vector' (points, lines, polygons),
      'raster' (a grid, a GeoTIFF), 'dataset' (either), 'plan', or 'none'.
    - **produces** — what you want back: 'dataset:vector', 'dataset:raster',
      'answer' (a number, nothing written), 'description' (what something IS,
      rather than a computation over it), 'plan_result'.
    - **category** — the family, when you know it: vector, raster, terrain,
      hydrology, inspection, sql, network, planning, provenance, visualization,
      bridge.
    - **projected** — pass False if your data is in a geographic CRS (degrees),
      and every operation that would refuse it disappears from the results.

    `query` is then plain words for what you are trying to do, and it breaks the
    tie inside what is left. Describe the PROBLEM rather than the operation:
    "the coastline has too many vertices and the browser dies" works as well as
    the name of the tool, and better when you do not know the name.

    **If the answer comes back with `status: "unsure"`, it means the two ranking
    engines agreed on nothing** — usually the request was not understood rather
    than impossible. It carries both engines' guesses and a question; answering
    the question with the facets above is the fastest way through.

    `detail=True` adds parameters and worked example calls: use it on the exact
    operation name before calling an unfamiliar tool. An empty `query` lists
    everything that survives the facets, planned operations included.

    `engine` selects the ranker and every result says which one ran: 'auto' (the
    default) prefers embeddings and falls back to BM25 where the model cannot
    load; 'lexical' is BM25 alone, deterministic and network-free; 'vector'
    forces embeddings. The default changed on measurement, not preference, and
    the facets above matter far more than this choice.
