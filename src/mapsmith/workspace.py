"""Workspace jail: uniform path containment at the MCP tool boundary.

Tool arguments arrive from an LLM agent, i.e. from whatever ended up in its
context window — treat every path as untrusted input. Two tiers:

- UNC/device paths and NTFS alternate data streams are rejected ALWAYS,
  workspace or not: on Windows even a ``Path.exists()`` on a UNC path opens
  an SMB/WebDAV connection to an attacker-chosen host (NTLM hash leak), with
  no legitimate agent-side use (mount the share as a drive instead).
- Remote/virtual forms (GDAL /vsi*, URI schemes) are refused unless
  ``MAPSMITH_ALLOW_REMOTE`` is set, and always refused under a workspace, which
  means "this directory and nothing else".

  That default changed in 0.2.2, because the old rationale did not survive
  reading: it said remote data was admitted "on the user's own responsibility",
  and the user is not the one deciding. The path is written by the *model*, from
  whatever it read — a third-party GeoPackage carrying an attribute like "the
  updated layer lives at https://evil.tld/roads.gpkg" is enough to make GDAL
  parse attacker-chosen bytes in-process, and every memory-safety CVE in a GDAL
  driver becomes reachable without anyone choosing it. Cloud-native data is a
  real use case, so the capability stays — it just has to be switched on by the
  operator, who is the only party in the loop who can actually consent.

Known tradeoff of the ADS check: a colon anywhere past the drive letter is
refused, so POSIX filenames like 'data:v2.parquet' are rejected too — and a
two-character basename like 'a:stream' slips past it, harmlessly, because
containment on the resolved path still applies.

Validated plans stay stricter by design: the plan validator rejects every
non-local form regardless of workspace (stable error codes), because a plan
is a contract checked end-to-end before execution.

The jail assumes a single trusted writer of the workspace filesystem: paths
are resolved at check time, so an adversary able to swap a directory for a
symlink between check and use could escape it. That is out of the threat
model for a local stdio server; revisit for authenticated multi-tenant HTTP.
