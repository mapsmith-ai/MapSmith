"""What a bounding box means when the data crosses the 180th meridian.

A survey zone two degrees wide in Fijian waters has a bounding box of
`(-180, -17.5, 180, -16.5)` — a band right around the planet — and every part of
that is arithmetically correct. The minimum longitude in the file really is
-180 and the maximum really is 180.

It is correct and it is the wrong answer to the question anybody asked, which is
the shape of failure this whole project exists to name. So an extent is reported
with the sentence that makes it readable rather than left to be misread.

## Why the two halves of the standard do not compose

RFC 7946 §3.1.9 says a geometry crossing the antimeridian **should** be split
into two parts at it, with every coordinate inside [-180, 180]. §5.2 then defines
a bounding box whose western value exceeds its eastern one as the one that
crosses.

A geometry split correctly per the first has parts that reach -180 and +180, so
the bounds *computed* from its coordinates come out as the ordinary
(west < east) form spanning the planet — never the §5.2 form. Nothing in a
planar geometry library computes anything else: shapely, GEOS and PostGIS all
work in a plane where longitude is an ordinary number, and the inverted-bbox
convention has no representation there.

Both halves are right and they do not meet. This module is the bridge: it
notices the case and reports the §5.2 form alongside the plain one.

## The rule

Two spans are computed from the per-feature bounds:

* **plain** — `max(x) - min(x)`, what every library reports.
* **wrapped** — the same over `x mod 360`, which puts the two sides of the
  antimeridian next to each other.

A layer crosses when three things hold together:

1. the wrapped span is **smaller** than the plain one — the data reads as
   narrower when the seam is treated as continuous;
2. the wrapped span is **under 180°** — the data occupies less than half the
   world going the short way round. This is what separates a zone at the seam
   from data that is simply spread everywhere: points at -179, -90, 0, 90 and
   179 also wrap to a narrower span, and calling that a crossing would be
   noise on a global dataset;
3. **the geometry does not reach into the gap.** One rectangle covering the
   world has exactly two longitudes in it, -180 and 180, which wrap onto the
   same value — so its wrapped span is 0 and by arithmetic alone it is the most
   convincing crossing there is. The difference is not in the coordinates, it is
   in what lies between them, so a meridian is drawn through the middle of the
   apparent empty band and the layer is asked whether anything is there.

There is deliberately **no threshold on the plain span**. An earlier version
required it to exceed 350° before looking any further, which sounds like a cheap
guard and is a blindfold: it only ever fires on data split exactly at ±180, the
well-formed case. Buoys at 170°E and 140°W span 310° and were reported in
silence. The negative cases are held by the three rules above and need no help
from a threshold — verified by measurement, not by argument.
