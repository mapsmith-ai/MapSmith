"""Optional embedding retrieval for the operation catalog.

BM25 (:func:`mapsmith.catalog.rank`) stays the default: deterministic,
dependency-free, and sufficient at the current catalog size. This module is
the embedding layer the catalog docstring promised could be "layered on top of
rank() without changing the public API" — built early, while the catalog is
small, so that its quality can be *measured as the catalog grows* instead of
argued about later.

The model is a static embedder (a token lookup plus pooling — no transformer,
no GPU, and no network at query time): ``potion-retrieval-32M``, MIT, 512
dimensions, pinned to an exact revision below. Determinism has two halves and
only one belongs to the model: the artifact is pinned by revision, and a
golden-vector test pins the numbers themselves, so drift in any layer of the
stack fails a test instead of an analysis. Encoding is bit-identical across
calls in one process (measured); multiprocessing is disabled on purpose.

Optional extra: ``pip install mapsmith[retrieval]``. The model file (~130 MB
of artifacts, once) is fetched from the Hugging Face Hub on first use and
cached; offline installs simply keep BM25.
