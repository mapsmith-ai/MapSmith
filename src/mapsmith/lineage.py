"""Recover the lineage of a whole analysis from one file, by content.

A manifest describes one operation and points at no other record. Section 6 of
the specification says multi-step lineage does not need a pointer, because it is
already recoverable: hash the file in hand, find the manifest whose
``output.sha256`` is that digest, then take each of its ``inputs[].sha256`` and
repeat. The walk ends at a digest no manifest claims.

This module is that walk, and it exists because until now nobody had written
one. The specification described a consumer; ``get_provenance`` returned a
single record; and the thing this project says is its differentiator -- that the
unit of work is the **analysis**, not the call -- was true on disk and invisible
in the interface.

**Four requirements, and all four are about not overclaiming.** The first draft
of this module got two of them wrong, which is the argument for writing them
here rather than assuming they are obvious:

1. **A found hop is not a successful hop.** A manifest is REQUIRED even when
   verification fails, so a run that crashed after writing part of its output
   leaves a conforming record carrying the digest of those partial bytes. A
   walker MUST read ``verification[]`` on every hop and MUST NOT present a
   failed run as provenance without saying so.
2. **Silence about severity is not reassurance.** ``critical`` is OPTIONAL and
   its absence means the producer made no claim. Reading that as "not critical"
   is the one meaning the producer did not offer, and it is the one that turns
   a record announcing a failure into a clean bill of health. Nor is an empty
   ``verification[]`` a pass: zero checks that all succeeded is the guard that
   cannot fail, inside the tool that sells verification.
3. **The chain reaches only as far as producers recorded ``output``**, which is
   RECOMMENDED and not REQUIRED. A walk reports where it stopped instead of
   claiming a complete history, and every stop says why.
4. **An operation can point at itself.** Where output bytes equal input bytes,
   following the link returns to the same record forever. The cycle guard
   tracks the ancestors of the CURRENT path, never a global visited set: a
   lineage that rejoins is ordinary, and a global set would prune the second
   branch and print a shorter history with no sign anything was dropped.

**Where this goes beyond the reference walk, and why.** Requirement 4 forbids
*silently* dropping a rejoining branch. It does not require printing the same
subtree once per path that reaches it, and printing it that way is not viable:
paths through a diamond are exponential in depth, and a review measured 42
manifests on disk producing 49,149 steps and a 31 MB payload. So a digest
already expanded elsewhere in the walk is emitted again as a step -- the branch
stays visible, which is the point of requirement 4 -- carrying
``subtree_shown_at`` instead of a repeated expansion. Nothing is dropped and
nothing is silent; only the duplication is gone.

**Two things this adds that section 6 does not require.** The root digest is
computed from the bytes on disk *now*, so a file changed since its manifest was
written is reported rather than papered over. And when more than one manifest
claims the same digest -- which deterministic producers make ordinary, not
exotic, since two runs of one operation on one input write identical bytes --
the ambiguity is reported, and the record sitting beside the file wins for the
root. Picking whichever the filesystem listed first, silently, let a second
record rewrite an output's history with `verified: true`.
