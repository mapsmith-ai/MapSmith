"""Where a raster's values actually are — the one place that decides.

A grid of numbers is not a map until something says where each number sits, and
GeoTIFF says it in two ways that differ by half a pixel:

* **`RasterPixelIsArea`** — a value describes the cell it fills. The tie point in
  the header is that cell's upper-left corner. The default.
* **`RasterPixelIsPoint`** — a value is a sample at a grid node. The tie point in
  the header is the position of the first sample itself.

**GDAL folds that difference into the geotransform, so a reader going through it
has nothing to add.** Since RFC 33 (`GTIFF_POINT_GEO_IGNORE`, FALSE by default)
the GTiff driver shifts a PixelIsPoint tie point by half a pixel on read and on
write, so the geotransform is always area-oriented: the Raster Data Model says
AREA_OR_POINT "is not intended to influence interpretation of georeferencing
which remains area oriented". The sample of cell `(row, col)` is at
`transform * (col + 0.5, row + 0.5)` under either tag — which is what
`dataset.xy()` returns.

**This module said the opposite until 2026-09-25**, and so did Argleton trap 024,
whose builder claimed GDAL "leaves the geotransform alone, which is documented".
It is documented the other way. MapSmith added no half cell for a Point file on
top of GDAL's, which put every sample of a point-registered raster half a cell
north-west of where it is: on the Copernicus DEM, whose samples fall on whole
arc-seconds by its own documentation, 10.79986 where the sample is at 10.8. The
premise was never measured; one read with `GTIFF_POINT_GEO_IGNORE=TRUE`, which
shows the raw tie point, would have caught it (D-096).

## What the tag is still for

What a value MEANS: an average over a cell or a sample at a point, which is data
and is recorded in the manifest. And the engines that read the raw tie point
without GDAL's shift: the terrain engine does, and gets a Point file half a cell
wrong in the other direction, so it is handed an area-tagged copy with GDAL's
own geotransform (`whitebox_engine._needs_plain_copy`).

## What it does not fix

Nothing here changes what an operation MEANS. `preserve` carries the declaration
onto an output rather than answering what a resampled point grid represents.
