"""Which geoprocessing stack this machine has, and which one the caller chose.

MapSmith runs on its own engines — GeoPandas, GDAL, rasterio, Whitebox, DuckDB,
all open source — and that is the default. A caller who has ArcGIS Pro installed
can ask for it instead, and then Esri is used for what it does and the open
source stack for what it does not (D-056).

Three things make this more than a switch, and all three are measured rather
than assumed:

* **The available tool set is a property of the machine, not of the product.**
  Which tools a licence reaches depends on its level and on which extensions it
  carries, and both differ between two installations of the same version. So
  what the other stack can do is discovered at runtime, from the installation in
  front of us, rather than baked into a table here. (The counts behind that
  sentence were measured on one licensed machine and stay in this project's
  private notes: a measurement of somebody else's product does not belong in
  this repository, whatever it says.)
* **"Esri does not do it" is three different situations** — no such tool, this
  licence does not include it, or it needs an online service — and they lead a
  reader to three different decisions. They are never collapsed into one word.
* **Nothing is substituted in silence.** When a fallback happens the manifest
  records which engine actually produced the numbers and why the preferred one
  did not. A product that sells provenance and quietly swaps engines is selling
  the opposite.

What that adds up to today is one routed operation, `buffer_layer`: the set that
calls :func:`route` is the set that can be substituted, and everything else runs
on the open source stack whatever the variable says. Said here because the
opposite reading was a real defect — see `engines/esri.py` — and because a
docstring claiming a general property of three-line wiring is how it recurs.

## Why both foreign stacks are subprocesses

QGIS and GRASS are GPL, so MapSmith talks to them through `qgis_process` and
files — never an in-process import (invariant 7). ArcPy turns out to need the
same shape for an unrelated reason: it lives in ArcGIS Pro's own conda
environment, a different interpreter from the one MapSmith runs in, so
`import arcpy` is not available to us even if we wanted it. One discipline, two
reasons, and the same boundary: another process, files on disk, JSON back.
