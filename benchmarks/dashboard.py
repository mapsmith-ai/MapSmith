"""One page to watch MapSmith by, and to tune it from.

    python benchmarks/dashboard.py
    python benchmarks/dashboard.py --log /data/discovery.jsonl --argleton ../argleton
    python benchmarks/dashboard.py --out /tmp/mapsmith.html

Everything this project knows about itself is already computed somewhere: the
catalog counts itself, `discovery_report.py` recomputes the retrieval figures,
the degradation test measures the curve, and Argleton scores five engines
against traps with a truth derived by hand. It is all in different places and
most of it is printed once and lost, which is how a number ages into a claim.

This gathers it into one self-contained HTML file — no CDN, no fonts, no
analytics, works with the network off — with six panels:

* **Overview** — what exists right now, in numbers.
* **Operations** — every operation, by family and by whether a caller can
  actually find it. The tuning list: an operation nothing reaches does not
  exist, and this says which ones and at what rank.
* **Search quality** — the facet ablation, both rankers, and the degradation
  curve as the catalog grows.
* **Traps** — Argleton's families and what each engine does with them, MapSmith
  included and not flattered.
* **Answer the open questions** — the requests where the two model labellers
  disagree, and the cases the discovery log recorded, answered by clicking. The
  percentages recompute against your answers as you give them.
* **Trend** — every generation of this page appends a row, so the numbers become
  a series instead of a snapshot.

It is a snapshot: adding an operation or a trap does not change a file that has
already been written. Regenerating is one command, costs about ten seconds, and
keeps every answer you have given — answers are stored against the text of the
question, never its position.

`--argleton <path>` points at a checkout of the suite (a separate repository in
a separate organisation, deliberately). Without it the traps panel falls back to
the vendored citation in `docs/argleton-run.json`, which carries the run's
headline numbers but not the per-family detail.

<p class="quiet" id="subtitle"></p>

<div class="panel">
  <p><strong>A snapshot, and answering it is not wasted when it ages.</strong> Built from
  this checkout at the moment above; new operations, new traps and newly recorded searches
  appear when it is generated again. Regenerating keeps every answer you have given —
  answers are stored against the text of each question, never its position.</p>
  <p class="mono" id="regen"></p>
  <p class="quiet">Everything is local: your queries are in this file, nothing is uploaded,
  no script is fetched, and it works offline.</p>

<h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>
<p>Capability has no ceiling; the list an agent chooses between does. What matters per entry
is not that it exists but that a caller reaches it — an operation nothing finds does not
exist. The query used is the caller-phrased one where the degradation test has written it,
and the entry's own advertised example otherwise; found only by its own wording is not
found, so the column says which. Two columns because both answers are needed: <em>words
alone</em> says whether the entry's text carries its own meaning, <em>with facets</em> is the
case that actually happens and the one the design promises. <em>Declined</em> is neither
— it is the refusal gate firing because the two rankers shared nothing, and drawing it as
a miss would invent broken operations.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Search quality</h2>
<p>Over the <span id="q-answerable">–</span> requests both model labellers placed on an
operation that still exists. <em>Delivered</em> is not an accuracy figure: below the choose
threshold every survivor is handed over, so it measures whether narrowing ever drops the
answer — which is the property the design rests on, and the only one at 100%.</p>

  <p class="quiet">BM25 alone, in the caller's words, against a catalog subsampled to each
  size — three deterministic draws per query. This is the curve the embedding engine became
  a dependency for, and the reason the facets rather than the ranker carry the guarantee.</p>
