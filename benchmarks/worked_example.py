"""One real question, end to end: what gets searched, what gets chosen, what runs.

    Which parcels lie within 1.5 km of the river and sit at no more than 120 m,
    and how large is each of them?

Nothing here is illustrative. The script builds fixtures whose answer can be
worked out on paper, asks the catalog the way an agent would ask it — in the
words of the problem, not the name of a tool — writes down what came back at
every step, then validates and runs the plan and reads the manifests. The
diagram on the README and on the site is rendered from the JSON this emits, so
if a step changes, the picture changes with it.

    python benchmarks/worked_example.py            # print the trace
    python benchmarks/worked_example.py --json out.json

The point it exists to make is the middle column. A catalog of dozens of
operations, most of which take a layer and return a layer, and at each step the
question is not "which tool is best" but "how many could plausibly apply, and how
does the caller get from those to one". The answer is: declare two facts, read
what survives, choose. Never a ranker deciding on its own.
