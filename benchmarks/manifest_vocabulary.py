"""Every name MapSmith puts in a manifest that the specification does not define.

Run it:

    python benchmarks/manifest_vocabulary.py --write

Writes `docs/manifest-vocabulary.md`. In `benchmarks/` because that is where
this repository keeps the scripts that recompute what it publishes, not because
this is a benchmark.

## Why the page exists

Section 3.6 of the manifest specification makes `verification[].name` a closed
core plus extensions named `x-<producer>:<name>`, so that a consumer can branch
on it. MapSmith obeys that everywhere. But obeying it produces a vocabulary of
its own, and until 2026-09-06 **that vocabulary existed nowhere outside the
source** — a consumer branching on a check name had to read the engines to learn
what names there are, which makes mechanical only half of the thing section 3.6
set out to make mechanical.

## Why it is generated

A hand-written list of sixty names is worth what whoever last remembered to
update it was worth. The names are read from the source with `ast`, including
the ones on branches no test reaches — which is most of the interesting ones,
since a check that only fires on a defect is exactly the check nobody's fixture
triggers.

Two derivations of the same set now exist: this one and the vocabulary sweep in
`tests/test_verify.py`, which polices rather than lists. A test asserts they
agree. Two copies of one rule is how the rule quietly becomes two rules.
