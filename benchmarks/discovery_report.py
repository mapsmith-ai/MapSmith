"""Recompute every discovery number this project publishes, from the data in the repo.

Run it:

    python benchmarks/discovery_report.py

The pages say the numbers can be checked rather than believed. For a while that
was not quite true: the request set was published but the harness that turned it
into percentages was not, so a reader could inspect the queries and had to take
the table on trust. This is that harness.

What it recomputes, all of it from `tests/data/discovery_queries.json` and the
catalog itself, with no network and no model:

* how often the two independent labellers agree with each other — the ceiling;
* how many candidates survive each facet a caller can declare;
* how often our ranking puts the right operation in the top three;
* how often the right operation is in the answer at all.

One published number is NOT reproducible here and the report says so: the 69% for
a model handed the candidates and asked to choose needs that model. Everything
else is arithmetic over files in this repository.

`tests/test_discovery_report.py` runs this and asserts the README agrees with it,
so the two cannot drift.

    the same shape as the `category` defect, where a filter deleted the right
    answer in silence because 4.4 families were plausible per request.
