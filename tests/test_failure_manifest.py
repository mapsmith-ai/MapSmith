"""A writer that fails after its output reached the disk still leaves a record.

Invariant 2 says a dataset without a manifest did not come from MapSmith, and
section 4 of the specification says a conforming producer "emits a conforming
record for every dataset it writes, including failed runs". On 2026-09-25 a
pre-release conformance review measured that 20 of 59 writers broke both on
their failure path: a write or a check that raised left the dataset on disk
with nothing beside it -- `resample_raster` among them, two days after the
same defect was fixed in its twin `reproject_raster`. Each had been fixed or
left one at a time, which is how the twin was missed.

So the list here is the catalogue, and the failure is injected rather than
waited for, in the two places a writer can die once bytes exist:

- the WRITE: the call that writes the operation's own output leaves partial
  bytes and raises (a full disk, a driver error). Only writers that write
  through Python can be reached this way; Whitebox writes from its own binary.
- the first CHECK built once the output exists raises. Every writer builds its
  checks after writing, so this reaches all of them, Whitebox and `run_sql`
  included, and stands for any failure between the write and the manifest.

Each mode says how many writers it actually reached, and fails if that is
fewer than it should be: a sabotage that never fires proves nothing (D-079).
