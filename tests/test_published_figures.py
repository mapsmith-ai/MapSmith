"""Every figure this project publishes, checked against what produces it.

Seven published numbers turned out to be false on 2026-08-29, and every one of
them was found by accident while updating something else. The reason they
survived is not that nobody checked: `test_showcase.py` checks that the same
strings appear on both surfaces, and `test_discovery_report.py` checks the
ablation table and the sentences around it. What nobody checked was **whether a
figure stated in one more place was the current one**.

So the shape here is different from both. A figure is declared once, with the
code that recomputes it and the patterns that match wherever a page *states the
claim*. Every surface is then swept for every pattern, and each match must equal
the recomputed value. Adding a fifth place to say "our ranking gets 48%" cannot
go stale quietly, because the sweep does not care which file it is in.

Two rules make it work, and both were learned from checks that passed while the
thing they guarded was wrong:

* **Match the claim, not the number.** A pattern anchored on the sentence
  ("puts the answer in the top three") finds the figure wherever it is said. A
  check that only asks whether "53%" appears somewhere on the page passes while
  the headline table says 48% two screens away — which is exactly what happened.
* **A pattern that matches nothing is a failure.** Prose gets rewritten, and a
  pattern that quietly stops matching is a guard that has been switched off
  without anybody deciding to.

What this does NOT cover, deliberately: figures that are dated measurements.
"On 26 August the run said X" does not go stale — it says what it is. The rule
for a page is that a number is either recomputed here or attached to a date.
