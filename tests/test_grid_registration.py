"""Where a raster's values are, on the fixture that proved we did not know.

Argleton trap 024 plants a DEM that declares `AREA_OR_POINT=Point` and asks where
its lowest value is. The fixtures here are the trap's, rebuilt: the same 8x8
surface at 30 m spacing with a strict minimum at row 2, column 3, written once as
`Point` and once as `Area`.

**The answer is the same on both, and this file said otherwise until
2026-09-25 (D-096).** The trap's builder claimed GDAL "leaves the geotransform
alone" for a PixelIsPoint file. It does not: since RFC 33 GDAL shifts the stored
tie point half a cell on write and back on read, so its geotransform is always
area-oriented and the sample of cell (r, c) is at the centre of GDAL's cell. The
file written below with `from_origin(412000, ...)` and the Point tag stores its
first sample at 412015 -- and the lowest one at 412105, the answer this file
used to call the failure.

The oracle is the file's own statement, not GDAL and not MapSmith: the raw tie
point, read with `GTIFF_POINT_GEO_IGNORE=TRUE`, which under PixelIsPoint is the
position of the first sample (GeoTIFF 1.0, section 2.5.2.2).
