"""Every geometry declaration in the catalogue matches what the operation does.

`applicability.geometry` hides an operation from a caller holding another
family, so a declaration narrower than the code is the dangerous direction: the
operation vanishes, silently, for exactly the caller it could have served. The
behaviour tested here is therefore the refusal. For every argument that takes
only some families, each family it does not take must be refused with a message
about geometry; and the families the rows below accept, per operation, must be
the declared ones -- so a declaration added without a row here fails, and so
does a row that drifted from the catalogue.
