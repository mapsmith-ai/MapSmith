"""The embedding retrieval layer: pinned, deterministic, measured.

The golden vector pins the whole stack — model artifact (revision-pinned),
tokenizer, pooling, numerics. If any layer drifts, these numbers move and the
test says so before an agent's tool choice does. The ranking floors are loose
on purpose: they guard against total breakage (a swapped or corrupted model),
while the real quality tracking lives in the found@k comparison, which prints
its table rather than asserting taste.
