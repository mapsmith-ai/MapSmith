"""Shared fixtures, and one rule about the embedding engine.

The rule exists because of a build that went red on 2026-08-29 for a reason that
had nothing to do with this repository: Hugging Face answered 429 to the model
download and six tests failed, four of them because the vector engine could not
be had and two because the numbers they check are produced by whichever engine
was available.

`catalog.search` is built to survive that — it falls back to BM25 and says so in
the `engine` field — so the product behaved correctly and only the tests did not.
A test that asserts what the vector engine does must skip when the vector engine
cannot be had, exactly as it already skips when `model2vec` is not installed.
Someone else's rate limit is not a defect in our code, and a suite that reports
it as one teaches people to ignore red builds.
