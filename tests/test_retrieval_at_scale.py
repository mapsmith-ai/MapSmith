"""What happens at hundreds of operations, measured rather than extrapolated.

The catalog is 51 entries and is meant to grow to thousands (D-031, D-037). Four
points below 51 do not answer what happens at 800, and filling the gap with
invented entries would answer the wrong question: an invented distractor does not
compete, because it is not a plausible GIS operation written the way somebody
writes one.

So the distractors are real. whitebox-workflows ships 800+ tools with a name, a
category and a description, and they are the HARD case rather than a convenient
one: they are functionally close to each other and to ours, which invariant 6
names as the variable that matters — not the count.

The result is the one that matters for planning, and it reversed a conclusion
this repository had already drawn:

    catalog    BM25 found@3    embeddings found@3
         51             50%                   40%
        100             48%                   32%
        200             48%                   25%
        400             40%                   25%
        800             35%                   20%

Against near-neighbour distractors the embedding engine degrades FASTER, not
more slowly. That is not a contradiction of `test_retrieval_degradation.py`,
which draws its distractors from our own 51 diverse entries and answers "which
engine suits the catalog we have today" — the answer there is the embedding one.
This file answers "which survives the catalog we plan", and the answer is
neither. At 800 entries both are wrong more often than right, so scale will have
to be bought structurally — the applicability filter that narrows before ranking,
facets, and the clarification path — and not by choosing a better ranker.

Marked slow: it embeds ~850 documents. Run it with `-m slow` or in full CI.
