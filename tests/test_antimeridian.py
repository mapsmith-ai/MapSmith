"""A bounding box that spans the planet for data two degrees wide.

The Fijian survey zone in Argleton's trap 025 has a bounding box of
`(-180, -17.5, 180, -16.5)`, and every number in it is arithmetically correct.
It is also the wrong answer to the question anybody asked. These tests pin both
halves: the plain box still comes out unchanged, and the sentence that makes it
readable comes out with it.

The cases that matter are the ones where the arithmetic alone gets it wrong —
a rectangle covering the world has the same wrapped span as a zone split at the
seam — so most of what follows is about *not* claiming a crossing.
