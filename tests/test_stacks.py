"""Choosing a geoprocessing stack, and what happens when it cannot be used.

Most of these run on a machine with no ArcGIS Pro, which is deliberate: CI is
such a machine, and the path that matters most is the one where the preferred
stack is *absent*. A test suite that only exercised the happy path would leave
the fallback — the common case, since 924 of 2198 tools do not run on a Standard
licence — untested everywhere it runs.

The tests that need the real thing say so and skip.
