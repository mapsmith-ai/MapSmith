"""Every operation must be findable. One contract per operation, not one metric.

A catalogue-wide average hides the entry nobody can reach: 90% found@3 over
fifty operations means five are invisible, and the average will not say which.
D-037 made the catalogue the reachability layer — an operation `list_operations`
cannot surface does not exist for an agent — so discoverability is a property
each entry has to hold on its own.

The probe is the entry's own first worked example. That is deliberate and it is
free: every available entry already carries at least two, written as goals
rather than as invocations, and they are what the catalogue itself claims the
operation is for. If an operation cannot be found by the example it advertises,
one of the two is wrong — and the first time this test ran, it was the example.

`centroid_layer` advertised "label points for a polygon layer" and ranked below
`point_on_surface`. The ranking was right: a centroid can fall outside its own
polygon, which is Argleton trap 014, so advertising it for labels was our own
catalogue recommending the defect our suite measures. The example changed, not
the ranking.

WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS CHANGED ON 2026-08-28, and the reason is worth keeping.

It used to require each operation to rank in the top 3 for its own example. That
looks like a discovery contract and is really a ranking contract, with one bad
property: the only way to repair a failure is to reword the example until the
ranker likes it. Fifty entries tuned that way score well on the examples we wrote
and nineteen points worse on requests written by anyone else -- measured, on 155
of them. A test whose repair procedure is "fit the text to the scorer"
manufactures the number it then reports.

So the gate moved to the part that is deterministic and ours: the facets an entry
declares must never drop that entry, and the entry must reach the caller. Rank
INSIDE the delivered set is still measured, because it is useful, but it does not
fail a build -- an ordering is a hint, and hints are not contracts.
