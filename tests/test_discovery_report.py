"""The numbers on the README are recomputed here, not remembered.

Two of them were wrong for a day and one for half a day, in both cases because a
measurement changed and a page did not. The pages also say the numbers can be
checked rather than believed, which was not quite true while the request set was
published and the harness that turns it into percentages was not.

So `benchmarks/discovery_report.py` recomputes everything from files in this
repository, and this test asserts the README carries what it produces. Editing
one without the other fails here.
