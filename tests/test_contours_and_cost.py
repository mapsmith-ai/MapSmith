"""Contours and least-cost routes, on surfaces whose answer is arithmetic.

The contour fixture is a plane: `z = column index` on a 10 m grid whose origin
is (1000, 5000). The cell holding value 3 has its centre at x = 1035, so the
3-contour of that surface is the vertical line x = 1035, exactly. That single
number is the test — and it is also the number the engine got wrong, by half a
cell, until it was measured.

The cost fixture is uniform. Nine steps of 1 m across cells that all cost 1
comes to 9, and no implementation detail can make it anything else.
