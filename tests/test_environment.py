"""The configuration that changed the answer, and the record that says so.

Section 3.8 of the manifest specification had no implementation until
2026-08-31: the field did not exist in `ProvenanceRecord`, so a whole section of
a published specification described something MapSmith could not produce.

Argleton trap 030 is what made that concrete. A GeoTIFF and the `.aux.xml`
beside it declare different georeferencing; GDAL prefers the sidecar by
documented design, because that is how somebody overrides georeferencing they
know to be wrong. Both readings are the library behaving as written. What was
missing is the sentence naming which one produced the numbers — and MapSmith
answered 160 000 m² where the file's own tags say 40 000, silently.
