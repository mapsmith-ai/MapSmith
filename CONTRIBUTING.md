# Contributing to MapSmith

Thanks for your interest! A few ground rules keep this project sustainable for a small team.

## Ways to contribute

- **New operations**: open a PR adding an engine function + MCP tool + catalog entry + test. Small, focused PRs merge fastest. (There is deliberately no plugin API yet — new tools land in core through one review queue.)
- **Bug reports**: use the issue template. We aim for a **first response within 48 hours**.
- **Docs & analysis notebooks**: gallery examples (prompt → tool chain → map) are as valuable as code.

## Environment support policy

**Docker (or `uvx` where wheels work) is the only supported install path.** Issues that reduce to a broken local GDAL/compiler setup will be closed with a pointer to the container. This is not unfriendliness — it is how a small team keeps the 48h response promise.

## Development setup

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
pytest -q
ruff check .
```

## Design rules (enforced in review)

1. **Deterministic outputs only.** No geometry or numeric result may originate from an LLM.
2. **Every writer emits provenance.** If your operation writes a dataset, it writes a manifest (`ProvenanceRecord`) — inputs with checksums, parameters, CRS decisions, engine versions.
3. **No silent CRS decisions.** Reprojections and unit assumptions must be recorded in `crs_decisions`.
4. **GPL isolation.** GPL engines (QGIS, GRASS) may only be invoked as external processes (CLI/files/JSON). Never `import qgis` or link GPL libraries in-process.
5. **Few semantic tools.** New MCP tools need a strong case; prefer extending the catalog + existing tools.

## Contributor License Agreement

To keep dual-licensing possible (AGPL + commercial), we ask contributors to sign a lightweight CLA on their first PR (automated via bot). Your code always remains available under AGPL-3.0.

## Code style

Python ≥3.10, `ruff` clean, type hints on public functions, tests for every operation.
